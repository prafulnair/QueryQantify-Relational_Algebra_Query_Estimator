# QueryQantify-Relational_Algebra_Query_Estimator
A Python-based system for estimating the result size of Relational Algebra (RA) queries. Inspired by ML Wiki techniques, it calculates the number of tuples in query outputs using statistical metadata about relations. This project simulates a DBMS query optimizer, handling arbitrary RA queries and computing intermediate and final result sizes.
